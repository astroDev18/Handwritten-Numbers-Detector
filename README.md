# Handwritten Numbers Model

A Machine Learning Model that reads handwritten numbers and predicts what value they contain. It achieves 97% reliability in tests.

## Getting Started

You can download the project and run the jupyter notebook file, the base_model.ipynb shows the base ML Model, and the second optimized_model.ipynb shows the more effecient model. 

### Prerequisites

Have a working VS Code editor setup with Jupyter Notebooks plug-in installed

### Installing

Download the project, then hit run at the top for the Jupyter Notebook to execute. It should run all code cases after that point, no further setup needed.
